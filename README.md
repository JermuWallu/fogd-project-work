# FOGD Project Work - 2D Platformer Game
I made this game for a course prject in 2 days. its A fast-paced 2D platformer game built in Godot 4.4 as part of a game development course project.

**Rest of this readme was made by Github Copilot (AI)**

## Summary
**Course**: Fundamentals of Game Development

**Engine**: Godot 4.4

**Language**: GDScript

**Development Time**: 2-3 days (check first and last commit
)
## 🎮 Game Overview

This is a precision platformer where players navigate through challenging levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and environmental hazards. The game features a timer-based scoring system that encourages speedrunning and replay value.

### Key Features

- **Precise Movement Controls** - Responsive character movement with acceleration/deceleration
- **Timer-Based Scoring** - Millisecond-precision timing for competitive speedrunning
- **Dynamic Lighting System** - Placeable torches with realistic shadows and ambient lighting
- **Gravity Powerup** - Reverse gravity mechanics for advanced platforming
- **Enemy AI** - Patrolling enemies with chase and return-to-spawn behaviors
- **Environmental Hazards** - Spike traps and deadly obstacles
- **Health System** - Visual heart-based health display with damage immunity frames
- **High Score Tracking** - Persistent best times with new record celebrations
- **Complete Menu System** - Main menu, settings, and final stats screens

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This game was developed as part of a **Fundamentals of Game Development (FOGD)** course project to demonstrate:

- Game design principles and mechanics
- 2D physics and collision detection
- User interface design and implementation
- State management and data persistence
- Audio integration and feedback systems
- Scene management and transitions
- Performance optimization techniques
